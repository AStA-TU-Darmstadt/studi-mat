# Studi-Mat
Studi-Mat is a "Voting Orientation Application". It is based on the similar app [Mat-O-Wahl](http://www.mat-o-wahl.de/) but does not share much code with it any more and is not compatible.

## Rating algorithm
We use [the same model](http://www.bpb.de/system/files/dokument_pdf/Rechenmodell%20des%20Wahl-O-Mat.pdf) as the Wahl-O-Mat by the German 'Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung (bpb)' to calculate the conformity of the user to the different parties.
