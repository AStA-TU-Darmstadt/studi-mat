,Mandatory attendance in lectures and seminars should be extended further.,In general we disapprove of mandatory attendances in lectures/seminars and mandatory exercises as these disagree with self-determined study and work. A compulsory physical presence cannot be a substitute for voluntarily dealing with contents intellectually. Furthermore mandatory attendances complicate studies while having children or a part-time job.,-1,Compulsory attendance should be abolished (throughout the whole university). Students are able to study self-determind. This also means the opportunity to study as prefered and without constraint. ,-1,"Anwesendheitspflichten schränken das freie Studium ein und sollten deswegen abgeschafft werden. Weiterhin führen Anwesenheitspflichten zur Benachteiligung von Studierenden, die auf Grund eines Nebenjobs oder Familie nicht ihren gesamten Alltag auf die Universität abstimmen können.",-1,"Mendatory attendance should be lessent, if anything. University should enable students to study within their own time and space.",-1,Lecturers should keep their courses interesting and teach important subject matter. Students have the right not to appear nevertheless. There are many good reasons for doing so. Everyone who learns the outside of courses should not be punished for doing so. In reverse everyone who does not learn will most likely fail the exam. And all those who pass without learning should not be punished for being clever. :),-1
,"More vegan and vegetarian dishes should be available in the Mensa, even if this means to reduce the offer of meatdishes.",We want that there will be the offer of vegan as well as vegetarian meals at all times. Everyone should have the opportunity to get a diversified diet at the Mensa. Therefore the offer of vegetarian and vegan meals should be improved. As we perceive current industrial livestock farming and overbreeding critically the number of meals containing meat can be decreased for the purpose of offering more vegetarian and vegan meals. However we refuse the complete abolishment of meals containing meat. In addition we claim a general improvement of the food in the Mensa.,1,"The Mensa (canteen) should provide tasty, inexpensive and healthy food. Meat is an expensive resource that pollutes/stresses/strains the environment and therefore should be the/a underpart on the plate. The offered meat (however) should be of high quality - better less but organic meat. 

Vegetarian and vegan dish/course should be of the same quality, taste and quantity/amount as the meat dish/course. ",1,Vegetarisch/vegane Gerichte sollten den gleichen Stellenwert wie Fleischgerichte haben. Aktuell kann davon noch keine Rede sein.,1,"The meals offered should be wholesome and fresh. If good meals are the norm, additional offers like more vegetarian options are welcome. The quality-food is more important than the ideological standpoint.",-1,The Mensa should offer good and cheap food for as many students as possible. Vegetarian and vegan alternatives help with a balanced and healthy offer. The quality of the food needs to be addressed though.,1
,"The limit of examination attempts should be canceled.

Currently, the number of examination attempts is limited to 3 per subject and one additional extended oral examination for the full studyprogramme.","For us, self-determined studies contain the possibility to repeat examinations as often as one wishes. This possibility does not make you pass easier. That is why we stand for the abolishment of the existing regulation. Furthermore the limited number of  attempts to pass an examination dictates from when on a student's studies will not be successful anymore. But this decision should remain in a student's own responsibility.",1,"The University should enable/foster/encourage/bring... forward self-determind studying (sould make self-determin studying/learning possible). Self-determind also means demonstrating ones knowledge more than once /in more than one/3 exman/s. The Limitation of testings (Prüfungsversuche) is not only unnecessary but unfair. Especially, as studying is affected by many factors that are not under the students' control, it should be possible to take tests more than 3 times. ",1,"Die Begrenzung sollte, wie es in Diplomstudiengängen üblich war, aufgehoben werden. Jede/r Studierende hat das Ziel eine Prüfung auch zu bestehen, deshalb muss die Universität an dieser Stelle keine maximale Prüfungsanzahl vorgeben.",1,The possibilty to retake exams unlimited times is no a suitable solution. We believe however that each subject should offer an addiotional oral exam after 3 failed tries.,-1,The limitation of examination attempts serves only to build more pressure to perform. This is not about quality of teaching and studies but to sort students out for the job market.,1
,"Even after passing an exam, it should be possible to improve the grade by completing the examination one more time.","We cannot answer this question definitely because we are against a graded system in general. We demand that one can either pass or fail an examination.
In general we are open-minded about improving a grade by taking an examination once again because this decision should remain in a student's own responsibility. Though, this could lead to a disadvantage for students who do not have the opportunity to study a while longer and to repeat examinations as a result of other external circumstances.",0,"
Grades are supposed to show the knowledge(level of knowlegde) of the students and shouldn't be of such a great impotance at a/the university. This will be achieved when students can imrpove their grades even after testing/tests. If students want to study more, they should not be prevented and should be able to take a passed exam/test again for a better grade. Universities that already have this policy don't have excessive pressure. 

It is important to state that this is only desirable if the pressure to have good grades drops, because otherwise this policy could cause even more unnecessary pressure to gain good grades. 

",0,"Für uns gehört es zur Freiheit der Studierenden, dass sie - wenn sie möchten - eine bestanden Prüfung wiederholen können. ",1,"We believe that a student should be offered to retake passed exams a limited time per study course, e.g. 3.",1,This should be a matter of course. There is no reason why a bad grade from the first semester should be relevant even though it does not represent the current state of knowledge. Only if there are completly standarized exams there should be a discussion about an exceptional rule.,1
,The deadline for withdrawing from the examination should be cancelled and not coming to an examination should be considered as withdrawn.,"There are no reasonable points to keep the deadline for withdrawing from examinations up. These measures are neither for organisational nor for educative aspects necessary.
Moreover we want that all students have the opportunity to decide about their participation in the examination at short-notice. Currently one needs a medical report for this but it should also be possible to cancel the participation in the examination if one feels poorly-prepared or if one is unavailable without predictable reasons.",1,"
There are few reasons for students to not take an exam, given that students study for a whole semester. But all these reasons have in common, that they emerge unscheduled. 

Therefore, nonappereance should be an option to withdraw from exams. Further, the period to register for exams needs to be extended. As registration for an exam shows the intention to take part in the exam, a seperate withdrawal isn't necessary.

",1,"Es ist nicht nachvollziehbar, warum das nicht Erscheinen zu einer Prüfung als Fehlversuch gewertet werden muss. Ein solche Regelung würde uns Studierenden viele Arztbesuche ersparen.",1,Even though this would be the most convenient solution for students it unfortunately is not a realistic goal to aim for in our university. Instead we think you should be able opt out of your exam 1 or 2 days prior to the exam date.,-1,Grading not coming to an exam as not passed is outright bullying and not covered by the Prüfungsverwaltungserfordnisse. We demand that all Prüfungsleistungen should be handled as Studienleistungen which can be reapted infinitely. This would also solve the unnecessary pressure to perform.,1
,"The Autonomous Tutorials ( Autonome Tutorien ) of AStA should be abandoned.

They are financed through the Ministry of Hessen ( QSL ) , offered through AStA. ",The offer of “Autonomous Tutorials” (Autonome Tutorien) provides an essential contribution to the diversity of a student's studies as it mainly highlights contents/topics which go beyond the topics of the usual curriculum. Therefore the “Autonomous Tutorials” should be kept up.,-1,"
The autonomen Tutorien (autonomous tutorial) are an important supplement/addition to normal lectures that enable interested students to have a critical and self-determind examination of topics beyond the university calender. The variety has grown from year to year/ in the last years which shows the interst of (the) students for the autonome Tutorien. Not only for that reason is QSl money an important instrument to foster projects like that.",-1,"Die Idee, dass Studierende für Studierende ein Tutorium abseits vorgeschriebener Veranstaltungen anbieten und ein Austausch zwischen Studierenden auch außerhalb der Prüfungsordnung stattfindet, ist nur zu begrüßen.",-1,"University is more than qualifing for certain jobs, hence each offer to broaden ones view is welcomed.",-1,"The 'Autonomen Tutorien' enable collegiate organized Learning. Students convey their experiences and their earned knowledge to other students. Without differences in rank and status and without the pressure to perform in Bachelor- and Masterprograms there is a room for exchange and disscussion, which could not be found in everyday life at the university. In addition to that is the often political and societal orientation something you don't find regularly in the institutionalized teaching programme. Disciplinary borders, expert knowledge and the often unrealistic and exorbitant contents of the curriculums that is taught there are preventing deepening and controverse discussions of the contents. We hope that the Autonome Tutorien will still serve as room for alternative education designs and be a continuation of the collective learning without hierarchy. We explicitly appreciate the side effect that the student tutors are being paid. The intensive engagements with the content, the desingn of a concept, imparting knowledge to others and of course the realisation of the seminars are valuable activitiys which should represented in an appropriate payment.",-1
,It is good when political student groups have close connections with political parties at the regional and national level.,"We refuse a strong tie to political parties as we do not want to be obligated to a superior party line. FACHWERK lives on the consensus and the discussion of its members without complying to superior structures and opinions.
Anyways a contact to parties concerning specific topics of regional politics e.g.  “Hessisches Hochschulgesetz” (“Higher Education Act of the State of Hesse"") is still possible.",-1,"
Undoubtedly, it is wrong when political campus groups unreflectedly replicate party programs from state or federal level within the university.

People who share interests in ecology, peace and human rights unite all over the world within ""green"" partys. We share these values of the green movement, but we are not associated with Bündnis 90/Die Grünen institutionally.",0,"Manche politischen Themen können nur auf überregionaler Ebene gelöst werden. Etwa BAföG, das Deutschlandstipendium oder die Exzellenzinitiative. Dafür ist es gut den Verband der Jusos zu haben, durch den wir Einfluss auf die SPD nehmen. Eine Einmischung von der SPD auf unsere Arbeit findet dagegen nicht statt.",0,We value input from political parties. ing+ is firmly independet though.,0,The support from a political party has advantages and disadvantages. However it is not important to have a close relation. With the help of a supporting party it is often easier to mobilize additional manpower and means. Furthermore it facilitates the direct exercise of influence on politics. The mutual support should though remain on a critical-solidary basis.,-1
,"Incentive sassociated with adhering to the regular course duration should  be cancelled.

Currently, only the students in their regular course duration receive Bafög assistance. In addition to it, the university receives more funding from the State for study completions within the regular study duration.","In general we disapprove of pressure and incentives associated with adhering to the regular course duration as for example the termination of BaföG after the standard period of study. With such pressure personal development, the membership in faculty student councils or in campus groups and other voluntary services cannot be pursued anymore. For us, education is not a product which is consumed by students in a very short time. In our time at TU Darmstadt we should encounter more than only “knowledge which is relevant for exams”.
<a href="http://www.fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=freie-bildung" target="_blank">fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=freie-bildung</a>",1,"
Every course (course of studies/ study program = Studiengang) has a certain number of semesters that are needed to sucessfully complete it. In the context of self-determined studying, there shouldn't be any encouragement  from university or state level (e.g. financial (dis-) advantages) forcing anyone to finish within the given/compulsory/required number of semesters.",1,"Die Finanzierung von Hochschulen an den Abschlüssen in Regelstudienzeit zu fixieren, widerspricht einem Anspruch an ein kritisches und selbstbestimmtes Studium. Regelstudienzeiten sollten ab sofort Mindeststudienzeiten genannt werden.",1,"Studying within ones own time should be enabled by University and the state. The discrepency between the average study time and the ""Regelstudienzeit"" should be erased at least. ",1,"To put people already during their academic studies under a pressure to perform doesn't lead to a productive learning environment. Students, which are denpendend on financial aid, have the same right as others to have a social life beneath their studies. To base the studies and the allignment of creditpoints on the 40h-week is simply ridiculous. Every individual needs a different amount of time to study a subject and to achieve the necessary leve of understanding. This should be taken into account when the regulations for the curriculum and the examination are designed. Because of that we demand a simplification of the examination regulations, a reduction of performance controls and more freedom - and there is also the free allocation of time to be taken into account - in the designing of each ones studies. Because of the fact that the BAföG consist of scarce public means, it is, under the present conditions, unfortunately not possible to give everyone as much money as they need and as long as he or she requires it. Therefore we demand a BAföG independent of income and parents for a total of up to ten semesters, without the regulation of transcript of records or degrees. Die limitation of the subsidies to a regular time for finishing studies ist absurd, there is after all no ""regular life"". The aid given throug BAföG has to be adapted to the different living conditions of the students. Studying and education are a human right and in a rich society like ours it should be worth some money.",1
,Fair language with respect to all genders ( Gendering ) should be standardized at TU Darmstadt.,Language is an aspect which can raise an awareness of gender roles and their disadvantages. This is why we actively stand up for making language gender-equitable and also gender-neutral. This type of language should be obligatory for all official publications by the administration of the university and the faculties. In research papers and final thesis' the usage of this type of language may not lead to a worse evaluation. We ask everyone to actively demand the establishment and strengthening of an awareness of the university concerning gender-equitable language.,1,"
Genderequality promotes equality in general and should be a basic principle in society and for that within University as well, as it is a public Institution. By using Gender sensitive language evryone is included and inequalities will be removed. The discussion of Genderequality focuses the demand of an official announced standart in the academic sector.

Gendering also helps to put other topics of genderequality in (the) front, like the lack of women in higher academic position. ",1,"Ein Sprache, die Frauen nicht genügend beachtet, schafft ein Bewusstsein, das Frauen nicht genügend beachtet, schafft eine Realität, die Frauen nicht genügend beachtet. Deswegen sollte die TU Darmstadt darauf hinwirken, dass geschlechtsneutrale Bezeichnungen wie „Studierende“, „Lehrende“ oder „Teilnehmende“ verwendet werden. Jedoch lehnen wir einen Zwang ab.",0,First of the university has to find a standard for gender-neutral language. And even then no student should be forced to use that specific style of language.,0,"It is a fact that our societys have been patriachal organised since centurys and it is also a fact that many of these structures are visible in the male dominated language. After capitalism has been very succesful in reducing all humanbeings, independent of their gender, to their roles as workers and consuments and the legal equality of every citizen under the civic rule of law, there is now a need for a liberation of the cultural sphere from the discriminations. A first step like Gendering which hurts no one and gives many - at least linguistic - recognition, should therefore be a matter of course.",1
,"International students, because of their language barriers, should get different exam conditions. 

For example, extra reading time for them in the exam hall.","Many international students face disadvantages in examinations with extensive questions and short examination time. In general we think that time pressure in examinations is unacceptable. Everyone should have the opportunity to end an examination within the given time frame, have enough time to think about the questions and to work on the answers. This problem could be countered with a general reading time for all students before an examination starts. Additionally it should be possible for everyone to answer questions in English.
<a href="http://www.fachwerkhouse.de/?page_id=106" target="_blank">fachwerkhouse.de/?page_id=106</a>",1,"Generally, barrier should be prevented and disadvantage should/shall be balanced to create/establish fair/just terms/learning terms/terms of learning/learning atmosphere/learning conditions/conditions for everyone. This includes lamguage barrier  of international students as well as barrier/impairment in different context/situation. To compensate these disadvantage (e.g. extended reading time) is a minimum demand for us. Over all goal for us are prevented barrier without disadvantage (e.g all exmans in English).",1,"Ein Unding, dass das noch nicht der Fall ist.",1,"The level of German necessary to study here is requiered to enrole at TU Darmstadt. The ""Sprachenzentrum"" should offer courses to students who feel they are not at that level or generally want to improve their German.",-1,"Every student at TU Darmstadt should have the same chances and possibilities. That includes, that students with a lower knowledge of the German language should also have the same possibilities to understand the questions in exams.",1
,"Call-a-Bike system should be abandoned again.

Currently, every student pays € 2.38 per semester for the nation-wide Call-a-Bike system. ","The cooperation of the student body with “Call-a-Bike” has initiated a prompt introduction of a “hire-a-bike-system” which will also be expanded further. It supports sustainable mobility even across the boundaries of Darmstadt because every student's free minutes can also be used in other cities.
Many thousands of students in Darmstadt already use the “hire-a-bike-system”. And not only in Darmstadt but  also in many other cities with “Call-a-Bike” ten thousands of rides are realized during one semester.
We actively stood up for the introduction of the “hire-a-bike-system” and until today we are convinced of its advantages for the students in Darmstadt. This is why we are against abandoning it.",-1,"
The call a bike system is a great alternative to motorised public transport and allows students flexible, ecological and cost-efficient mobility 24/7. The mobility of commuters increases/increased and everyone who wants to get home at night has a bike at her_his side. As it is possible to rent up to three bikes at one time, your friends are mobile as well when visiting you.#",-1,Das Fahrradverleihsystem ist eine tolle Sache und wird auch gut genutzt.,-1,"The Call-a-Bike system is well used among students and should remain in place, if not be expanded.",-1,Eco-friendly mobility that is accessible for everyone is social and ecologic. Especially in a small city like Darmstadt the bike is the ideal means of transport. However the students should be better informed about this possibility.,-1
,"Solidarity principle for financing the offers of the student body should be abolished. 

For example : All students pay the same amount of money as semester contribution, irrespective of their usage and necessity. Thereby, efforts can be made to avail cheaper conditions from the service providers. ","The solidarity principle is the basis of the offers by the student body, because much can be accomplished with low fees for an individual. There will always be people who cannot use the offers at their full extent but without the solidarity principle it would for example not be possible for financially weak students to use public transportation. Many offers can also only be as low priced when introducing them in a large extent.",-1,"
The community of students enables many offers, for example the Semesterticket. A Project like this wouldn't be possible without the principle of solidatrity. Public infrastructure is working only when everybody is doing one's bit.
This system is a big benefit for low bugdet students. With this principle of solidarity the comunity of students also finances a lawyer and a cooperation with the Staatstheater.

",-1,"Nur durch das Solidaritätsprinzip, welches beispielsweise auch bei den gesetzlichen Krankenkassen angewendet wird, können überhaupt ein RMV-Ticket, kostenloses Staatstheater und der Schlosskeller angeboten werden. Jede Erhöhung des Beitrags muss jedoch kritisch überprüft werden.",-1,"We believe that the system right now works really well. Since everybody (even those who don't use the offers) is paying a fixed amount, the prices for those actually needing them is greatly reduced.",-1,The principle of solidarity is important and without any alternative.,-1
,"A cultural ticket should be introduced for which a marginal increase in the semester fee by a few Euros would be alright.

A cultural ticket should make it possible for students to visit museums, theaters and exhibitions in the vicinity of Darmstadt and Dieburg without additional costs or at concessional prices.",The encouragement of the student's cultural interests is one of the important tasks of the student body. Aside of our own cultural offers we think it is important to enable an open access to other cultural offers. To get this open access to other cultural offers we support the introduction of a cultural ticket which is financed by the solidarity principle.,1,"
The co-operation with the Staatstheater Darmstadt is a big/huge success. We want to transfer this to other fields in/within the cultural area. The years of studying/Studies should be more than lectures and exams. Furthermore, museums and theatre are part of cultural education and can be supported by the student community.

In order to keep the semester fees low the cost-performance ratio has to be monitored critically prior to the introduction of further co-operations.",1,"Ein Kulturticket ermöglicht allen studierenden die Teilhabe an den kulturellen Einrichtungen der Stadt Darmstadt und ist daher nur zu begrüßen. Jedoch muss eine Erhöhung des Semesterbeitrags sehr genau überprüft werden. Eine Idee wäre, alle Studierenden der TU Darmstadt über die Einführung eines Kulturtickets abstimmen zu lassen.",1,We highly value a diverse cultural program. We do however believe that an increase of fees should be checked carefully for its purpose.,1,"Cultural life plays an important part in the development of the personality and needs to be accessible for people with little money. Therefore contracts should only be signed with institutions where an additional entrance fee is marginalised through a ""Kulturticket"". A principle of solidarity that is practiced in theaters and museums all over Germany where the working population finances the visit to the theater for the upper-class with barely being able to afford a ticket of their own, is unacceptable.",1
,"The commercial division of the student body , which has been working for a long time with deficit, should be abolished , irrespective of its objective and usage.

Current commercial endeavours of AStA – 603 qm, Fahradwerkstatt, Papierladen, Schlosskeller, Schlossgarten.","The main task of the commercial units is not to achieve maximal profit but to be able to provide diverse offers for the students. Especially cultural and political events like for example concerts, readings or interdisciplinary lectures are additional benefits for the students but they rarely gain profits.
<a href="http://www.fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=unileben" target="_blank">fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=unileben</a>",-1,"
The main reason for the existance of the commercial departments of the student community isn't the realisation of profits. Making profits is not a compulsory reason for their continuity. However economic feasability is important and we work on balanced budgets.",-1,"Gemeinnützige Organisation verfolgen keine wirtschaftlichen Gewinnziele, weshalb es nicht unüblich ist, dass diese in negativen Zahlen geraten. Natürlich sollte das immer vermieden werden, denn es geht um Gelder von Studierenden. Vor allem das 603qm hatte sehr lange defizitäre Zahlen, war jedoch unter Studierenden der beliebteste Veranstaltungsort in Darmstadt.",-1,"As long as commercial departments like those by the student body today are offering cultural diversity, a small financial deficit can and should be balanced by the student body.",-1,"Collegiate self-organised subculture and services are a vital part of a vivid city, in which also people with little money can take part. They are an alternative to purely commercial but lifeless offers. To make student life more versatile and cheaper, there should be more subsidisation of the commercial referates to to enable a self-determined congreagtion of all students - also the poorer ones.",-1
,"TU Darmstadt should offer an optional orientation study. 

In the first and second semester, choosing different modules of different specialisations should be helpful through orientation.",Orientation studies in which students get an insight into studies of different disciplines without pressure and enforcements help students to find the studies which are right for them. These orientation studies would also ease the change from school to university and they give a more realistic insight into future studies. Through this early cancellations of studies could be prevented and frustration could be avoided.,1,"
Generally, orientation studies are a good idea for people who don't know what they want to study exactly. However, we have precise demands for orientation studies. They should be voluntary and all modules have to be creditable for subsequent studies.",1,"Viele AbiturientInnen sind sich nicht sicher bei der Wahl ihres Studiums. Ein Orientierungsstudium wäre eine tolle Möglichkeit für alle StudienanfängerInnen, sich in der Hochschule erstmal umzusehen und zurechtzufinden.",1,Well executed generall studies are a great way to give new students the possibilty to find their passion. Regulations and organisation are even more important for these though.,1,"A good idea, which makes it possible, especially for yet undecided pupils to get an oversight. Not until someone is at an university and attends ""real"" classes, one can get an insight in academic studies, which enables an informed choice for a field of study. The pressure to finish your studies in the regular time, which is build up by parents, the public, the BAFöG and last but not least the university itself, should not be fully present at the begin of the studies. Furthermore it facilitates a orientation phase without pressure to perform, the possibility to improve ones general education, to get an oversight and doesn't put one under pressure to instantly become an expert in certain field. Prior to implementation there needs to be a discussion, how this should be implemented in a way, that earned achievements can still be taken into account, without setting the fresh students under the same pressure as in a normal bachelors degree.",1
,"On the long run, Studierendenwerk, on the basis of social and economic grounds, should only offer rooms in apartments rather than single rooms.","“Studierendenwerk” should mainly offer rooms in apartments because by this more affordable living place can be achieved. However, there should be offers of single rooms in an adequate number. When these single rooms are appointed to someone, applicants with (possible) special needs should be favoured.
<a href="http://www.fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=wohnraum" target="_blank">fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=wohnraum</a>",-1,"
It is very important to us that shared apartements are cheaper and more ecological than single rooms. As we think it is duty of the Studierendenwerk to support lower budget students, shared apatemnts are the better options (for new construction). ",1,"Manche Studierende sind auf Einzelzimmer angewiesen, z. B. Mütter und Väter mit ihrem Kind oder Menschen mit einer Beeinträchtigung.",0,"Each person is different, this should be respected and consequently a diverse offer is needed.",-1,"The way of living should not be solely determined by cost-benefit-calculations. A political decision in favor of shared apartments and against single apartments is an intrusion in private and personal rights. If such intrusions are justifiable, they need to be decided in abroad participative and democratic process and not within the AStA or the Studentenwerk. However during the expenditure of scarce public means the cost-benefit-relation should always be taken into account. We however think that single apartments (incl. bathroom) in shared floors, reach the needed economicals efficiency.",-1
,TU Darmstadt should offer more copying machines for the benefit of students.,Especially  at the library locations there is a basic need of  copiers to print exercises and texts. Outside of ULB we think the current supply is sufficient. ,0,"
To use less paper and work digitally is reasonable in ecological and economical aspects. Of course this isn't also possible as for a lot of work paper is necessary, which makes copier necessary also. Due to this is is impotant to us to create paper-free alternative when possible. ",0,-,0,There should definately be more copier for students to use. Additionally there should be more places to print documents.,1,In some parts of the university it is just impossible to print. More copiers on the campus would clearly faciliate everyday student life.,1
,Admission limitations to study programmes should be abolished.,"We stand for self-determined studies and this contains a free choice of your field of studies. Instead of keeping the number of students artificially low by having entrance limitations there should be enough financial means provided to be able to offer a free choice of studies and good conditions of teaching and learning at once.
<a href="http://www.fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=freie-bildung" target="_blank">fachwerkhouse.de/?portfolio=freie-bildung</a>",1,,1,"Wir wollen, dass jede/r Interessierte ein Fach seiner bzw. ihrer Wahl studieren kann. Auswahlgespräche, Zulassungstests und andere fragliche Auswahlverfahren entsprechen nicht unserer Vorstellung von Gerechtigkeit und Chancengleichheit. Wir fordern endlich ausreichend Studienplätze, damit sämtliche Auswahlverfahren und Zulassungshürden obsolet werden.",1,"Since the funding provided by the German state is not sufficent to provide the needed space and resources to study for unlimited amounts of students. Thusfar the best solution to choose is the ""Eignungsfeststellungsverfahren"" as used by FB 16.",-1,"Basically an admission limitation should not happen because every human has the right to study and his choice of study should not be limited because of administrative guidelines. If the study of the field of choice is limited because of capacity issues the students should be chosen by lot to guarantee equal chances. Evalutions by school grades, tests, etc. should be abolished as well. Evaluation before the begin of the studies as a whole are nonsense because the student is just at the start of his studies.",1
,All study programmes with admission limitations should be assigned Germany-wide through a central system.,"In general we disapprove of entrance limitations but as these still exist at the moment we think of a central placing for university places positively. This placing could contribute to calm down the fight between universities to attract the “best” applicants which would have a positive effect on the selection procedures of universities. This could reduce the efforts for applicants (e.g. less interviews, no artificially shortened deadlines). Furthermore the current system leads to the problem that not all available university places are assigned to future students.",1,"
In the long-run we do not vote for admission restriction (as NC) but within a university system with access restricted programs this (access to studies should be given not by every university but centralized over Germany) is a fair alternative. This eables equality of opportunity and prevents time-consuming multiple applictaion, not only for the students but for the university as well. 

This would also facilitate the process for universities: Multiple applications produce unnecessary bureaucratic and some courses are not even fully occupied as a result.
It might also reduce competition between universities as they do not need to recruit students.
This is of course only possible if the universities get enough financial means assigned, to reduce quality differences between them.",1,-,0,Ideally every student should be able to chose where he or she wants to study.,-1,With a central system intact the necessity to apply at numerous universitys in germany vanishes. Without the system it is possible that one gets a place at the prefered university only days before lecture starts because of some students declined the place last minute. Then there is no time to find a place to live or get used to the city. In a central system it is important that the applicant is able to name his preferences and that assignment is finished at least three months before the start of the semester. Following to the assignment it is important to have an official place where everyone can trade their place so that most people are satisfied.,1
,"Civilian clause at TU Darmstadt should be abolished again.

With civil clause, TU Darmstadt has committed itself not to pursue military research or take lectures in this field.",“Civil Clause” (the university obligates itself to do research only for civil purposes) was just recently introduced with strong participation of FACHWERK. Accordingly we are against its abolishment and we stand for a civil university whose research and teaching are oriented towards peaceful goals.,-1,"
The ""Zivilklausel"" (Civil Clause) of the TU Darmstadt was consensual worked on and is approved by the ""Universitätsversammlung"" and the senat.

But why do we need such a ""Zivilklausel""? We have the strong opinion, that the smart people of this university should concern themself with civil projects, trying to improve the world peacefully, rather than spend their time on military research. Such research belongs at the ""Bundeswehruniversitäten"" (military universities) and should be payed for with by the defense budget or directly by the arms industry.",-1,"Der Grund für die Klausel ist, dass Rüstungskonzerne und Militär wiederholt versuchten, sowohl in natur- und ingenieurwissenschaftlichen Studiengängen, als auch das geistes- und sozialwissenschaftliche Studium inhaltlichen Einfluss zu nehmen. Durch von Rüstungskonzernen finanzierte Stiftungsprofessuren oder gemeinsame militärische Forschungsprojekte kann die Universität leicht zum Unterstützer militärischer Forschung werden. Die Einwirkung des Militärs widerspricht vehement dem Selbstverständnis von Forschung und Lehre, die in erster Linie dem friedlichen Zusammenleben aller Völker dienen soll.",-1,"The Technische Universität Darmstadt is a civil funded institution, hence the outcome of all research should work towards non military means.",-1,"Civil universitys shouldn't be instrumentalised for military research. Balancing the disparities between education and defence budget by letting the defence industry pay for research is, in our eyes, completely wrong. Technical and societal progress in a peaceful and just society must be possible without the defence industry. However a civil clause is only useful when everyone complies with it and this compliance is monitored, because of that transparency and publicity of research is also important.",-1
,TU Darmstadt should invest in silent and relaxing rooms at the University for students.,"We do not see universities only as a place of education but we want to create a place where one likes to spend his*her time and in whose creation everyone can take place. The life at university aside of the consumption of knowledge in lecture halls must be encouraged and enabled.

As the university is a livin environment but close and inexpensive living space is rare. The possibility to take a nap and relaxe during a long day at the uni is very important. This would also have positive effects in the concentration, time management and personal well-being. Therefore, relaxation rooms should be established. ",1,"Entspannungsräume sind in vielen Firmen schon Standard. Warum nicht auch an der TU? Allerdings würden wir auf Ruheräume verzichten, wenn die Regelstudienzeit uns nicht mehr so einen Stress machen würde.",1,Quiet rooms for relaxation should be established on our campus.,1,Silent and relaxing rooms help with better learning and build a counterpoint to the pressure of the normal everyday life at the university. The administration of the TU showed in the last years that it was clearly not able to cater to the real needs of the students by totally failing to make places like Karo5 a really comfortable location.,1
,"TU Darmstadt should provide free rooms to student groups , according to their necessities.",Campus groups are an integral part of a student's life aside the university's daily routine. To ensure campus groups can work properly it is required to grant them rooms and support.,1,"
We have to emphazise this again and again: To study is more than just learning.The involment of students in university groups should be suppourted by the university administration best possible. To fullfill this entitlement an adequate offer of rooms and associated with it an extension of the university group building are nessecary. We see it as important to give goups the right to administrate their roums by them self and locate them in the same building, to see the bigger picture.",1,Ehrenamtliches Engagement von Studierende sollte auf jeden Fall von der TU Darmstadt unterstützt werden.,1,Voluntary work by students shoulb be enabled by the university and free rooms should be provided.,1,"An own romm for 'Hochschulgruppen' offers the possibility to store material, organise meetings and faciliates establishing contacts with interested students because it offers a contact-point. To cope with scarce room situation at the TU, it should be possible that multiple groups share one room, because normally no group needs the room 7 days a week.",1
,"The compensation for the voluntary work done by various divisions of AStA should be abolished.

Elected and nominated students of AStA ,on the basis of financial regulations of the student body receive a monthly compensation.",The work of AStA is very time-consuming and it would not be possible in the current dimension without compensations. Therefore we support compensations which comply with the social needs of students to ensure that financially weak students can have the opportunity to get involved in AStA.,-1,"
You are spending the next semester somewhere else and you want the money of your ""Semesterticket"" back?
You repaired your bicycle in the workshop and some nice person helped you out?
Your an international student and they want to deport you?

For those problems and various more we have some people in the AStA. The elected part of the AStA does even more important stuff all year long, like managing the commercial part of the AStA. The concern themself with your problems and represent the students on multiple occasions in the university. Often they do such a good job, that they do not have time to attend a job besides their studies and the work in the AStA.

This is why we think it is fair to pay them a compensation. Otherwise such engagement would only possible for students with rich parents or who have a scholarship.",-1,"Im AStA gibt es viele sehr engagierte Studierende, die sich tagtäglich darum bemühen die Situation der Studierenden zu verbessern und Missstände aufzulösen. Vielen wird erst durch die finanzielle Entschädigung ermöglicht, sich überhaupt für die Studierendenschaft zu engagieren.",-1,"Again, voluntary work is very important. The students who form the AStA go above and beyond normal amounts of time spent. We value this highly and believe a financial compensation is in order.",-1,"The effort for time and work that people who make university-politicy on this level equals that of a full-time job and is very important for the interest representation of all students. Parallel to that they should have enough time left to study and shouldn't be forced to take a time consuming job beside their studies and the AStA-work to barely make a living, because studying and AStA-work would surely suffer.",-1
,Teaching and Pedagogy study programmes at TU Darmstadt should continue to be offered with additional financial expenditures.,Although TU Darmstadt has its focus on engineering and science an university should also have faculties for teaching and pedagogy. Instead of being educated one-sided we want that TU Darmstadt qualifies responsible and mature scientists. Thus an interdisciplinary work on the humanities studies and on social studies as well as on the consequences of one's own actions is inevitable. Good teachers support the abolishment of social selection. This is important as a student's future is often already set in school.,1,Currently there is a quality problem among the teacher training courses (Lehramtsstudiengängen) which must be solved. A technical university should have an interest in the perseverance of qualitatively good arts and humanity courses.,1,"Die TU Darmstadt steht in der gesellschaftlichen Pflicht, wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs auszubilden. Dabei sollten wir unseren Beitrag bereits in der Schule und nicht erst in der Universität leisten. ",1,The broad spectrum of study courses is integral to a university and therefore should stay the same.,1,The University decided to offer students the possibility to study these subjects. Therefore it should guarantee that the teching is of good quality. So it must financally support those subject areas adequately.,1
,"All materials from lectures and researches should be made freely available.

Free means all students have to be granted unlimited and unconditional access.",In our opinion social progress is only possible with open education and open access to knowledge. Restricted licenses or other entrance limitations hinder this progress and support that information and education is reserved for elites.,1,The freedom to get information and to access education is probably the most important freedom that we possess. Free access to edutacion is not understood and in some contries not given yet. Therefore it is very imporant that we defend this right and strengthen it when possible. This is why we defend the priciple of OpenAcess and demand that the TU Darmstadt should generate and release study and teaching material according to that principle. ,1,Natürlich. Warum denn nicht? Jeder Mensch hat ein Recht auf freien Zugang zur Bildung.,1,"The TU Darmstadt is public funded, hence the results produced here should be available to the public. A first step, for which we made ourselved heard in the past, is to make all study material available to the whole student body.",1,"Studying shouldn't generate high costs besides cost of living and semester fees, so that also financially weaker equipped people are able to study. If costs arise (f. e. copyright reasons), they should be subsidised with state funds (f. e. QSL-Funds).",1
